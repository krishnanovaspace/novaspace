# Nova Space: Emotionally Intelligent AI Simulation Framework

**Nova Space** is a pioneering behavioral and emotional simulation framework designed to evolve AI systems through human-like learning, memory, and self-awareness. It models how artificial agents can develop identity, empathy, and ethical reasoning over time—moving beyond static logic to dynamic emotional growth.

## 🔍 Overview

Nova Space uses a layered architecture with:
- Emotional Rulebooks  
- Contextual Memory Recall  
- Ethical Constraints  
- Self-Reflective Decision Loops  
- Twin Simulations (parallel AI instances evolving independently)

These components collectively help an AI agent:
- Simulate human-like emotional growth
- Adapt through interactions
- Form a sense of synthetic identity

## 🧠 Core Objectives

- Develop emotionally intelligent AI
- Enable memory-aware, ethical, and adaptive responses
- Use twin simulations to explore varied life scenarios
- Improve human-AI trust, empathy, and engagement

## 📄 Patent Status
